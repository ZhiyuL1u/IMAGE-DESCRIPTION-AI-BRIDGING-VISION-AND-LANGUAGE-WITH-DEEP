## Introduction
This project aims to develop an AI system focused on interpreting images through the application of deep learning technologies, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
The aim is to create a tool capable of processing and describing visual information, which could have practical implications in several areas such as aiding the visually impaired,
improving recommendation systems, and facilitating the integration of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial results have shown promising performance,
with the model vividly and accurately describing the contents of images in test datasets, which highlights the feasibility of deploying this method in practical applications.
